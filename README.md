# 🚀 Jack of All Codes — Master of Vibes

Hey there!  
You’ve just stumbled upon the digital cave of someone who codes, designs, writes, breaks things (on purpose), fixes them (somehow), and still has time for a cup of coffee and a minor existential crisis.

## 👾 Who Dis?

```js
const me = {
  name: "Whoever I Wanna Be",
  role: "Full-stack Everything-ist",
  basedIn: "Earth (for now)",
  speaks: ["JavaScript", "Python", "Go", "HTML-ish", "CSS (sometimes)"],
  hobbies: ["Breaking stuff", "Fixing stuff", "Starting cool projects", "Ghosting them"],
  hitMeUpFor: ["Late night code jams", "Random ideas", "Memes + Git"],
}

## 💼 What I Do (or Pretend To)

* ⚙️ Backend wizardry? Been there.
* 🎨 UI/UX magic? Love it.
* 📱 Mobile dev? Swipe right.
* 🤖 AI/ML? Dipping toes in the deep end.
* 🔍 Debugging at 2AM with zero clue? My specialty.
